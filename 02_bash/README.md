# Bash

```bash
# print working directory (where you are right now)
$ pwd

# change directory. `..` goes down a directory
$ cd <path>

# navigate to your home directory
$ cd ~

# list files where you are
$ ls

# make directory (aka folder)
$ mkdir <name>
```

Other fun bash commands for the curious (we won't be practicing them today):

```bash
# delete a file (CAREFUL, no undo!)
$ rm <file>

# delete a directory (CAREFUL, no undo!)
$ rm -r <directory>

# rename/move a file
$ mv <old> <new>

# look at the contents of a file; j/k to move down/up, q to leave
$ less <file>

# create new file
$ touch <file>

# open the current directory in your Finder
$ open .

# prints "some stuff here"
$ echo 'some stuff here'

# create newFile.txt and put 'some stuff' into contents
$ echo 'some stuff' > newFile.txt

# puts 'more stuff' on a new line at end of current contents
$ echo 'more stuff' >> newFile.txt
```
