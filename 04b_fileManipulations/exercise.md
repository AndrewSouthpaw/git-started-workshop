(Each step along the way, "commit the change" means do the typical git cycle:)

```bash
$ git status
$ git add ...
$ git commit -m 'some commit message'
```

- [ ] Create a file "foo.md" and commit the change.
- [ ] Add a couple new lines to the file and commit the change.
- [ ] Rename "foo.md" to be named "bar.md" and commit the change.
- [ ] Delete "bar.md" and commit the change
- [ ] Create a folder called "questions" and add a file "question1.md" into that folder, and commit the change.
- [ ] Rename the folder to "queries" and commit the change
- [ ] Delete the folder and the containing file and commit the change.
