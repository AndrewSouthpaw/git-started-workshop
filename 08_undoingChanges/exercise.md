Undoing changes in your "working directory"

- [ ] Make changes to several tracked files in git, and then clear the changes
- [ ] Make a bunch of new files
- [ ] See what would happen if you cleaned your git
- [ ] Actually blow away all the untracked files
- [ ] Add several changes and stage them
- [ ] Try to wipe them away using `git restore .`, notice what happens
- [ ] Unstage your changes
- [ ] Wipe away the changes

Undoing commits

- [ ] Create some changes and commit them. Rollback the commit but don't discard the changes.
- [ ] Commit these changes again with a different commit message.
- [ ] Rollback the commit again and discard the changes this time.
- [ ] Mourn the loss of those changes. Think carefully about using the previous command, because it's hard to get them back (though [not impossible](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/rewriting-history/git-reflog)!)
- [ ] Make some new changes and create a commit.
- [ ] Make a *new* commit that undoes the changes in a previous commit.
