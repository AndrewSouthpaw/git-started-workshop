# Exercise

- [ ] Create a feature branch with a few commits on it
- [ ] Copy one of those commits to master
- [ ] Rebase your feature branch off master
- [ ] Think about what it means when a commit appears "empty" (it will be the one you cherry-picked)
- [ ] You can skip past that empty commit with `git rebase --skip`
- [ ] Copy a range of commits from one location to another
