- [ ] Create a folder called `git-playground` and navigate into the folder
- [ ] Initialize a git repo

(Each step along the way, "commit the change" means do the typical git cycle:)

```bash
$ git status
$ git add .
$ git commit -m 'some commit message'
```

- [ ] Create a new file called "question.txt", write out a question (course-, professional-, or personal-related) you have for me, and commit the change.
- [ ] Edit "question.txt" and add another question, and commit the change 
- [ ] Amend your commit message to say something else
- [ ] Add another question to "question.txt" and 
- [ ] Recall what your question was for me, and be prepared to ask me that question!
