# Installation

## MacOS

Install git via `Homebrew`, a super-cool utility that helps manage tools for your laptop.

[Install brew](https://brew.sh/) by pasting this code into your Terminal app:

```
$ /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

Then, install git:

```
$ brew install git
```

Check that git is installed with:

```
$ git --version
```

## Windows

Download the [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) app, which also installs `git` and a few other useful settings for you.

If you have Windows 10, follow [these directions](https://itsfoss.com/install-bash-on-windows/) to install bash on Windows. It works better for you, yay!

For operating systems before Windows 10, download [Cygwin](https://cygwin.com/install.html) so you can run bash commands like the other cool Mac kids.

Verify git is installed by typing this command:

```
git --version
```
