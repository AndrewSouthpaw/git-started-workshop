# Installation

## MacOS

Install git via [Homebrew], a super-cool utility that helps manage tools for your laptop.

[Install brew](https://brew.sh/) by pasting this code into your Terminal app:

```
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

## Windows

Download the [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) app, which also installs `git` and a few other useful settings for you.
