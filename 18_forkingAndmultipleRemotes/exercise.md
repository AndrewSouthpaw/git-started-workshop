# Exercise

- [ ] Fork the [demo](https://github.com/AndrewSouthpaw/git-demo-2021-11-12) repository
- [ ] Clone your fork
- [ ] Add the original repo as a remote and call it `upstream`
- [ ] Create a new branch `feature-1` and add a few commits
- [ ] Push up your branch to `origin`
- [ ] Try to push up your branch to `upstream` and see what happens (it won't let you; why?)
- [ ] Wait for the instructor to add a few commits to `main` on the upstream repo
- [ ] Fetch their latest refs (don't merge yet!) and then look at the history
- [ ] Notice how `origin/main` and `upstream/main` differ
- [ ] Pull down their commits and update your local branch `main` with rebasing
- [ ] Update your origin `main`
- [ ] Refresh your feature branch with these new commits using merge
- [ ] Create a PR, and get it merged using squash and merge!
