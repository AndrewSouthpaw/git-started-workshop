# Exercise

- [ ] Create a file "placeholders.txt" and add the line `foo is a common placeholder name used in computer science`
- [ ] Commit the changes using VIM with the following commit message and description:

```
Add explanation of the term foo.

The term "foo" can be confusing to someone unfamiliar with computer science.
After much discussion, we decided to add its meaning to a new file.
Link to meeting notes: www.foo.com/foo-meeting-notes

- [ ] Oops! The term isn't "foo", it's really "foobar". Rewrite the contents of "placeholders.txt" to include the line `foobar is a common placeholder name used in computer science`
- [ ] *Amend* the previous commit, and rewrite the commit message and description:
