# Exercise

- [ ] Create a `feature` branch and add 5 commits
- [ ] Do an interactive rebase where you:
    - [ ] Drop a commit
    - [ ] Edit one's message
    - [ ] Squash one into a previous one
    - [ ] Squash another where you discard the log message
- [ ] Delete the branch
- [ ] Create a `feature1` branch and add a few commits
- [ ] Create a `feature2` branch off there and add a few commits
- [ ] Rebase the new `feature2` commits onto master, so it's no longer using `feature1` commits
