A workshop to learn the beginner and intermediate features of git.

## Welcome! 👋 Read me first!

Hi there friend! 

Presumably you're here because you're taking Andrew's git course.

Most of the config will be done during the class. We will walk through getting started together. 🤝

However, git can take a long time to install. [Follow these instructions](./01_installation/installGit.md) to install git. If you get stuck, we can troubleshoot it during the first day of class.
