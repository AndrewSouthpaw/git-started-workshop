A workshop to learn the beginner and intermediate features of git.

## Welcome! üëã Read me first!

Hi there friend! 

Presumably you're here because you're taking Andrew's git course.

You don't need to do anything right away. We will walk through getting started together. ü§ù

If you want to get a head start on installation, check out [module 1](./01_installation/README.md).

## Day Retros

- [2021-05-21](https://forms.gle/CZ3LyWgeJ8wSA13K9)

## Course Evaluation

TBD

## Slides

View/download [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Tfogzs9FqPhGePpTiP6XU1wCWDmvDe9Q/view?usp=sharing).

## Git Visualization

We'll sometimes use [Git School - Visualizing Git](http://git-school.github.io/visualizing-git/) as a tool for visualizing git operations.

## Better bash prompt

Download `.bash_prompt` and move it to your `~` directory (these directions will clobber your old bash prompt, so make a copy of it):

```bash
$ cd ~
$ mv .bash_prompt .bash_prompt.bak # do this if you have a current bash_prompt you want to
                                   # save; typically you don't need to if you're new to bash
$ git clone https://github.com/AndrewSouthpaw/git-started-workshop.git
$ cd git-started-workshop
$ cp .bash_prompt ~
```

Open up a new bash shell and voil√°. This is adapted from a [particularly famous dotfile](https://github.com/necolas/dotfiles/blob/master/shell/bash_prompt), tweaked so you don't need to download other customizations upon which the original dotfile depends.
