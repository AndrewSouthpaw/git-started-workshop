# Exercise

Part I - easy

- [ ] Find a pairing buddy
- [ ] Person A create a new repo on GitHub and add Person B as a collaborator
- [ ] Person A create a file called "favoriteFood.md" and put in your favorite food
- [ ] Person A commit and push changes
- [ ] Person B pull down the latest from the repo
- [ ] Person B Add another file called "favoriteCity.md" and put in your favorite city
- [ ] Person B commit and push changes
- [ ] Person A pull changes
- [ ] Do the same cycle, but instead of using `git pull`, use `git fetch` to see how the refs update, and then use git merge

Part II - intermediate

- [ ] Person A *and* Person B both create a commit locally.
- [ ] Person A push their change to origin
- [ ] **Before you do it**, Person B imagine you're going to do `git pull`. What should happen?
- [ ] Person B do a pull, add the merge commit, and push the newly created merge commit
- [ ] Person A now pull to see the new merge commit along with Person B's changes.
- [ ] Do that same thing again, but this time use `git pull --rebase` and see how that's different.
