```bash
$ pwd # print working directory (where you are right now)
$ cd <path> # change directory. `..` goes down a directory
$ cd ~ # navigate to your home directory
$ ls # list files where you are
$ less <file> # look at the contents of a file; j/k to move down/up, ESC to leave
$ touch <file> # create new file
$ rm <file> # delete a file (CAREFUL, no undo!)
$ rm -r <directory> # delete a directory (CAREFUL, no undo!)
$ mv <old> <new> # rename/move a file
$ mkdir <name> # make directory (aka folder)
