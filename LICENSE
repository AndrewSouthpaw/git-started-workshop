The materials in this repo are the creative property of Andrew Smith. They are published openly on GitHub to increase accessibility for learners. They are not shared for others to use for commercial purposes.

If you'd like to use these materials for your own commercial use, speak with the author about licensing.

In short:

- If you're a student in my class, use for yourself or share with other learners (and encourage them to take a class!).
- If you're a teacher and want to use my material, chat with me about licensing and I'm sure we can come to a reasonable agreement.
